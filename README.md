Programming Exercises for Combinatorial Optimization
===

This repository contains Lukas' and my solutions to the programming exercises for the lecture Combinatorial optimization in the winter term 2018/19.

Prog1 is the first programming exercises. We should implement the Edmonds Matching Algorithm from the book Combinatorial Optimization by Korte and Vygen. We received full marks.

Prog2 is our start for the second exercise that we did not quite finish. The task was to implement the Minimum Mean Cycle Canceling Algorithm. We succeeded in implementing the minimum T-join subroutine and were awarded about half of the points.
